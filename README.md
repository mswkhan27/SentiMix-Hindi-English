# SentiMix-Hindi-English
SentiMix Hindi-English - NLP Project


Introduction:
The task was to predict the sentiment of a given code-mixed
tweet. The sentiment labels are positive, negative, or neutral,
and the code-mixed languages will be English-Hindi and
English-Spanish. Besides the sentiment labels, we will also
provide the language labels at the word level. The word-level
language tags are en (English), spa (Spanish), hi (Hindi),
mixed, and univ (e.g., symbols, @ mentions,
hashtags). Efficiency will be measured in terms of Precision,
Recall, and F-measure.

Proposed Approach and Results are given in the Paper/Project Report.
